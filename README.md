# Logistic Regression from Scratch (Iris Dataset)

This project implements **Logistic Regression** using **Gradient Descent** from scratch with **NumPy** â€” without using any built-in ML libraries.

## ðŸ“˜ Description
- The algorithm is trained on the **Iris dataset** (two classes only).
- Uses the first two features for easy visualization.
- Implements the **sigmoid function** and **binary cross-entropy loss**.
- Displays the **decision boundary** between the two Iris classes.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
3. Run all the cells to:
   - Train the logistic regression model.
   - View the loss updates.
   - Visualize the decision boundary.

## ðŸ§  Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
